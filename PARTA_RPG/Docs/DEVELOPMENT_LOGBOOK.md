## Latest Updates (2025-08-29)

### 2025-08-29 16:20 - Droid Integration and Code Refinements

#### Key Implementation Changes
- **Droid Reference in Player Class**
  - Modified `Player` class to accept and store a reference to the `DamagedMaintenanceDroid` instance
  - Updated `use_tool_on_droid()` to directly call `self.droid.repair()`
  - Ensured proper encapsulation while maintaining clean separation of concerns

- **GameController Updates**
  - Updated Player initialization to pass the droid reference
  - Maintained existing command processing flow with enhanced droid interaction
  - Preserved all game mechanics and scoring system

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Added comprehensive docstrings for all modified methods
  - Ensured type hints and error handling consistency
  - Verified all game commands function as expected with the new implementation

#### Key Development Prompts and Solutions

1. **Droid Integration Challenge**
   - **Prompt**: "The droid's repair method needs to be called when using the tool, but the Player class doesn't have access to the droid instance. How should we handle this?"
   - **Solution**: Modified the Player class to accept a droid reference during initialization, enabling direct interaction while maintaining clean architecture.

2. **Command Processing Refinement**
   - **Prompt**: "The game needs to handle the 'use tool' command by calling the droid's repair method. How should we structure this interaction?"
   - **Solution**: Implemented a direct call to `droid.repair()` within the Player class, with proper state management and return values.

3. **Game State Management**
   - **Prompt**: "How should we handle the droid's blocking state and its interaction with the player's movement?"
   - **Solution**: Maintained the droid's blocking state in the Location class while allowing the Player to modify it through controlled methods, ensuring consistent game state.

## Recent Development (2025-08-28)

### 2025-08-29 00:15 - Game Flow and Win Condition Implementation

#### Changes Made
- Implemented proper game flow according to the storyboard
- Added dynamic exit handling for the Docking Bay
- Fixed the crystal pickup sequence to trigger gravity reset
- Added the final win condition with the 'win' command
- Updated location descriptions and hints to guide the player
- Added scoring system with hazard tracking
- Implemented proper game state management

#### Key Features Added
1. **Docking Bay Exit**
   - East exit is initially locked until crystal is collected
   - Location description updates after crystal pickup
   - Hint system guides player to next objective

2. **Win Condition**
   - Player must type 'win' at the Launch Pad
   - Final score calculation with 30-point completion bonus
   - Proper game over sequence with statistics

3. **Hazard System**
   - Tracks number of times player is pushed back by droid
   - Hazard count displayed in status
   - Affects final score calculation

### 2025-08-29 00:50 - Help Command & Docking Bay Hint Improvements

#### Changes Made
- Added fully functional `help` command to `GameController`.
- Updated Docking Bay description and crystal pickup feedback to hint: *"Type 'win' to escape"*.
- Removed obsolete Launch Pad location—map now strictly `Maintenance Tunnels` ⇄ `Docking Bay` per spec.
- Introduced dynamic `win` entry in help once crystal is obtained.
- Incremented mission-completion bonus (+30) in `_process_win`.

#### Implementation-Plan Alignment
- Checked off completed tasks in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
  - **Player**, **GameController**, **World setup**, **All core commands**.
- Remaining items: automated tests (golden path & edge cases) and minor documentation polish.


### 2025-08-28 19:10 - Core Game Systems Implementation

#### GameController Class
- **Game State Management**:
  - Tracks game over and win conditions
  - Manages turns and game flow
  - Handles initialization of game world

- **Command Processing**:
  - Processes player commands (movement, item interactions)
  - Validates and executes game actions
  - Provides appropriate feedback

- **World Building**:
  - Initializes all game locations
  - Sets up connections between locations
  - Manages game objects and their interactions

#### Player Class
- **State Management**:
  - Tracks current location and inventory
  - Manages score and hazard count
  - Handles item interactions

- **Core Methods**:
  - `move(direction)`: Handles player movement and droid blocking
  - `pick_up_item(item_name)`: Manages item collection and scoring
  - `use_item(item_name)`: Handles item usage (e.g., using tool on droid)
  - `get_status()`: Returns current score and hazard count
  - `has_won()`: Checks win conditions
  - `get_inventory()`: Lists items in inventory

### 2025-08-28 18:52 - Abstract Classes and Core Components

#### Abstract Base Class Implementation
In `items.py`, we're using Python's `abc` module to define `StationItem` as an abstract base class (ABC):

1. **Enforces Implementation**: Ensures all subclasses implement required methods
2. **Prevents Direct Instantiation**: Only concrete implementations can be instantiated
3. **Enables Polymorphism**: Allows uniform treatment of different item types
4. **Improves Type Safety**: Catches errors at development time

#### DamagedMaintenanceDroid Class
- **State Management**:
  - Tracks repair status and activity state
  - Manages droid descriptions based on state
  - Handles path blocking behavior

- **Core Methods**:
  - `repair()`: Attempts to repair the droid using the diagnostic tool
  - `block_path()`: Checks if the droid is currently blocking the path
  - `get_description()`: Returns the current description based on state
  - `reset()`: Restores the droid to its initial damaged state

## Previous Development (2025-08-26 to 2025-08-27)
