## Recent Development (2025-08-28)

### 2025-08-29 00:15 - Game Flow and Win Condition Implementation

#### Changes Made
- Implemented proper game flow according to the storyboard
- Added dynamic exit handling for the Docking Bay
- Fixed the crystal pickup sequence to trigger gravity reset
- Added the final win condition with the 'win' command
- Updated location descriptions and hints to guide the player
- Added scoring system with hazard tracking
- Implemented proper game state management

#### Key Features Added
1. **Docking Bay Exit**
   - East exit is initially locked until crystal is collected
   - Location description updates after crystal pickup
   - Hint system guides player to next objective

2. **Win Condition**
   - Player must type 'win' at the Launch Pad
   - Final score calculation with 30-point completion bonus
   - Proper game over sequence with statistics

3. **Hazard System**
   - Tracks number of times player is pushed back by droid
   - Hazard count displayed in status
   - Affects final score calculation

### 2025-08-28 19:10 - Core Game Systems Implementation

#### GameController Class
- **Game State Management**:
  - Tracks game over and win conditions
  - Manages turns and game flow
  - Handles initialization of game world

- **Command Processing**:
  - Processes player commands (movement, item interactions)
  - Validates and executes game actions
  - Provides appropriate feedback

- **World Building**:
  - Initializes all game locations
  - Sets up connections between locations
  - Manages game objects and their interactions

#### Player Class
- **State Management**:
  - Tracks current location and inventory
  - Manages score and hazard count
  - Handles item interactions

- **Core Methods**:
  - `move(direction)`: Handles player movement and droid blocking
  - `pick_up_item(item_name)`: Manages item collection and scoring
  - `use_item(item_name)`: Handles item usage (e.g., using tool on droid)
  - `get_status()`: Returns current score and hazard count
  - `has_won()`: Checks win conditions
  - `get_inventory()`: Lists items in inventory

### 2025-08-28 18:52 - Abstract Classes and Core Components

#### Abstract Base Class Implementation
In `items.py`, we're using Python's `abc` module to define `StationItem` as an abstract base class (ABC):

1. **Enforces Implementation**: Ensures all subclasses implement required methods
2. **Prevents Direct Instantiation**: Only concrete implementations can be instantiated
3. **Enables Polymorphism**: Allows uniform treatment of different item types
4. **Improves Type Safety**: Catches errors at development time

#### DamagedMaintenanceDroid Class
- **State Management**:
  - Tracks repair status and activity state
  - Manages droid descriptions based on state
  - Handles path blocking behavior

- **Core Methods**:
  - `repair()`: Attempts to repair the droid using the diagnostic tool
  - `block_path()`: Checks if the droid is currently blocking the path
  - `get_description()`: Returns the current description based on state
  - `reset()`: Restores the droid to its initial damaged state

## Previous Development (2025-08-26 to 2025-08-27)

### 2025-08-27
- **Command System Improvements**
  - Fixed `CommandRegistry.execute_command()` to properly call `execute` on command objects
  - Enhanced test suite with better output formatting and assertions
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all commands
  - Fixed test expectations to match actual command output
  - Improved error handling and test feedback
  - Implemented `run_test` helper function for consistent test output
  - Added tests for all major commands: help, move, examine, take, inventory, use, and quit

### 2025-08-26
- **Code Restructuring**
  - Recreated game with improved OOP structure and better principles
  - Established new file structure for better organization
  - Implemented core Item and Location classes with comprehensive test coverage
  - Set up initial command system architecture
