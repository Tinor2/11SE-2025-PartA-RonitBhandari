# Orbital Station Escape - Development Guide

## Project Overview
A text-based adventure game where the player must navigate a space station, solve puzzles, and escape using an escape pod. The game features multiple locations, interactive items, and obstacles.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Game Engine (MVP)
1. **Game State Management**
   - [x] Implement basic game state tracking
   - [x] Create Player class with inventory and location tracking
   - [ ] Implement game loop with command processing

2. **World Building**
   - [x] Create Location class with exits and items
   - [ ] Implement world initialization from JSON
   - [ ] Add location descriptions and interactions

3. **Item System**
   - [x] Create base Item class with ABC
   - [x] Implement specific items (Diagnostic Tool, Energy Crystal)
   - [ ] Add item interactions and effects

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics
1. **Command System**
   - [ ] Implement command parser
   - [ ] Add core commands:
     - `go [direction]` - Move between locations
     - `take [item]` - Pick up items
     - `use [item]` - Use items in inventory
     - `examine [item]` - Get item descriptions
     - `inventory` - Show carried items
     - `look` - Re-examine current location

2. **Puzzle Implementation**
   - [ ] Droid repair puzzle in Maintenance Tunnels
   - [ ] Energy Crystal collection in Docking Bay
   - [ ] Escape pod activation sequence

3. **Scoring & Hazards**
   - [x] Implement score tracking
   - [x] Add hazard system
   - [ ] Add win/lose conditions

### Phase 3: Polish & Refinement
1. **User Interface**
   - [ ] Format console output for better readability
   - [ ] Add color and ASCII art
   - [ ] Implement help system with command list

2. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add input validation
   - [ ] Implement graceful error recovery
   - [ ] Add descriptive error messages

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Unit tests for core systems
   - [ ] Integration tests for game flow
   - [ ] Playtesting and balancing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Game Loop Structure
```python
while not game_over:
    display_current_location()
    command = get_player_input()
    result = process_command(command)
    update_game_state(result)
    check_win_conditions()
```

### Data Flow
1. Player inputs command
2. Command is parsed and validated
3. Game state is updated
4. Result is displayed to player
5. Loop continues until win/lose condition

### Save/Load System (Future)
- Save game state to file
- Load saved games
- Multiple save slots
1. Implement game state serialization
2. Create save/load functionality
3. Handle version control for save files

## 5. Testing
1. Unit test individual components
2. Integration testing for game flow
3. Playtesting for balance and user experience

## 6. Polish and Refinement
1. Add help system and tutorials
2. Implement command aliases and shortcuts
3. Add descriptive text and flavor text
4. Optimize code and improve error handling

## 7. Distribution
1. Package the game
2. Create installation instructions
3. Add documentation
4. Consider creating a launcher (optional)

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Implement proper error handling
- Write docstrings and comments
- Use version control
- Keep game data separate from game logic

## Extensions (Optional)
- Add graphics (ASCII or simple UI)
- Implement sound effects
- Add random events
- Create multiple save slots
- Add achievements or scoring system

## Resources
- Python Standard Library (json, os, sys, etc.)
- Text-based game frameworks (e.g., Textual, Pygame for text)
- Game design documentation templates
- Testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)
