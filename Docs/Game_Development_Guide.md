# Text-Based Game Development Guide

This guide outlines the general steps to create a text-based adventure game using object-oriented programming principles in Python.

## 1. Project Setup
1. Create a new project directory
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   game/
   ├── main.py                # Main game loop and entry point
   ├── player.py              # Player class and related functions
   ├── items.py               # Item class definitions
   ├── location.py            # Location class and world setup
   ├── commands.py            # Command handling and processing
   ├── game_controller.py     # Main game controller and state management
   ├── input_parser.py        # Input parsing utilities
   └── data/                  # Game data files
       └── game_data.json     # Game content and configuration
   ```

This flat structure is simpler to manage and doesn't require package initialization. All Python files can import from each other directly in the same directory.

## 2. Core Game Components

### 2.1 Game World
1. Design your game world structure
2. Create a `Location` class to represent different areas
3. Implement connections between locations (exits/portals)
4. Add items, NPCs, and interactive elements

### 2.2 Player System
1. Create a `Player` class with:
   - Current location
   - Inventory system
   - Health/score tracking
   - Movement methods

### 2.3 Command System
1. Implement a command parser
2. Create a base `Command` class
3. Implement specific command classes (e.g., `MoveCommand`, `TakeCommand`)
4. Handle input validation and feedback

### 2.4 Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
The `abc` module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes in Python.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **ABC (Abstract Base Class)**:
   - A class that contains one or more abstract methods
   - Cannot be instantiated directly
   - Used to define a common interface for subclasses
   - Example:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
     
     class Item(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def examine(self) -> str:
             pass
     ```

2. **@abstractmethod**:
   - Decorator that marks a method as abstract
   - Must be overridden by concrete subclasses
   - Ensures all subclasses implement required methods

3. **Benefits in Game Development**:
   - Enforces consistent interfaces for game objects
   - Makes code more maintainable and self-documenting
   - Prevents instantiation of incomplete classes
   - Helps catch programming errors early

4. **Example Usage**:
   ```python
   class Item(ABC):
       def __init__(self, name: str):
           self.name = name
       
       @abstractmethod
       def use(self) -> str:
           pass
   ```

### 2.5 Game Loop
1. Initialize game state
2. Create main game loop:
   - Display current location/status
   - Get player input
   - Process commands
   - Update game state
   - Check win/lose conditions

## 3. Game Content
1. Design game narrative and story elements
2. Create item descriptions and interactions
3. Implement puzzles and challenges
4. Add NPCs and dialogue systems (if applicable)

## 4. Save/Load System
1. Implement game state serialization
2. Create save/load functionality
3. Handle version control for save files

## 5. Testing
1. Unit test individual components
2. Integration testing for game flow
3. Playtesting for balance and user experience

## 6. Polish and Refinement
1. Add help system and tutorials
2. Implement command aliases and shortcuts
3. Add descriptive text and flavor text
4. Optimize code and improve error handling

## 7. Distribution
1. Package the game
2. Create installation instructions
3. Add documentation
4. Consider creating a launcher (optional)

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Implement proper error handling
- Write docstrings and comments
- Use version control
- Keep game data separate from game logic

## Extensions (Optional)
- Add graphics (ASCII or simple UI)
- Implement sound effects
- Add random events
- Create multiple save slots
- Add achievements or scoring system

## Resources
- Python Standard Library (json, os, sys, etc.)
- Text-based game frameworks (e.g., Textual, Pygame for text)
- Game design documentation templates
- Testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)
