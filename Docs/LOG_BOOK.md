## Bug Reports

### Command Execution Bug (2025-08-27) 
**Affected Version**: Pre-2025-08-27  
**Status**: Fixed  

**Description**:
A critical bug was discovered in the command execution system where the `CommandRegistry.execute_command()` method was incorrectly calling a non-existent `execute_command` method on command objects instead of the correct `execute` method. This caused all command executions to fail with an `AttributeError`.

**Impact**:
- All game commands were non-functional
- Players couldn't interact with the game world
- Test suite was failing with misleading error messages

**Root Cause**:
The issue stemmed from an inconsistency in method naming between the command registry and command objects. The registry was trying to call `execute_command` on command objects, but the command interface only defined an `execute` method.

**Resolution**:
1. Standardized on using the `execute` method name across all command objects
2. Updated the `CommandRegistry.execute_command()` method to call the correct method
3. Added comprehensive test coverage to catch similar issues in the future
4. Improved error messages to make debugging easier

**Prevention**:
- Added type hints and docstrings to clarify method contracts
- Implemented interface testing to ensure all commands implement the required methods
- Added runtime checks in the command registry to validate command objects

**Lessons Learned**:
1. The importance of consistent method naming across components
2. The value of comprehensive test coverage for catching integration issues
3. The need for clear interface documentation
4. The benefits of defensive programming practices

### 2025-06-30
- **Documentation**
  - Added UML class diagram
  - Completed and formatted storyboard with consistent text conventions
  - Ensured comprehensive .gitignore file

## Initial Setup (2025-05-26)
